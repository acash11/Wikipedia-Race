# Wikipedia-Race
“WikiRace” is an online game where players race from one Wikipedia page to another via hyperlinks. The goal is to achieve either the lowest time or the fewest possible hyperlink clicks. We will be using nodes and directed edges to represent web pages and their connections. With our project, we hope to find a unique way to analyze Wikipedia page association and potentially solve any given “WikiRace” challenge with the lowest ‘score’ possible. We will also look for interesting ways to visualize Wikipedia communities, and see if there is any way to apply semantic similarity scores to optimize any given search between two or more points.
